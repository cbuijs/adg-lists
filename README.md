# adg-lists

Specific lists to use for clients that are tagged with `ctag` as `user_child`.

NOTE: These are lists only to use with DNS blocking, they were converted from the full-sets so some stuff might be missing (especially cosmetic, URL and object-removal).

DISCLAIMER: TESTING - USE ON OWN RISK!
